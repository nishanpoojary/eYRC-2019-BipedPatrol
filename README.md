This is the challenge we pose in the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC 2019-20) in a unique theme “Biped Patrol”. This is based on the classic inverted pendulum control problem; the robot attempts to balance from an induced tilt angle by moving forward or backward, the same way we try to balance a stick on a finger. In addition to this, we will be using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Controller to balance our robot.

Through this theme, we had used our talent in designing and building a robot from scratch and learned how to build a challenging control system to balance a two-wheeled robot.

Divided the theme into a number of tasks to build a robot in a step-by-step manner. After building the bot, we need to navigate it in an arena defined by e-Yantra team to complete a set of tasks.
